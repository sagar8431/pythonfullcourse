"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is an English lullaby.
 The lyrics are from an early-19th-century English poem written by Jane Taylor, "The Star".[1] The poem, which is in couplet form, was first published in 1806 in Rhymes for the Nursery, 
 a collection of poems by Taylor and her sister Ann. It is now sung to the tune of the French melody "Ah! vous dirai-je, maman", which was first published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers, including Mozart with Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman".[2] The English lyrics have five stanzas, although only the first is widely known.
